# The Start up process

## Windows entry point

On Windows, the program uses `WinMain()` for the entry point.
From there, it simply starts without setting up a window, then straight away initializes logging, and jumps to `enterLoop()`.
This is one of the rare times Windows is faster than unix-based systems. 

## Unix-based entry point

On unix-based systems, the program uses the traditional `main()` for the entry point.
From there, it follows standard daemonization process, via `daemonize()`. Then, it calls `initLog()` and jumps to `enterLoop()`.

## enterLoop()

`enterLoop()` starts by checking for the don't boot file, and the sleep file.
If the sleep file is found, then sleep is flagged.
Then it calls `genCache()`, and checks `state.internalErrno`, and if it's equal to `FILESYSTEM_INVALID_HASH_RECORD`, the program is terminated via `fatalErr()`.
Integrity checks are made, if any of them fail, the program is terminated via `fatalErr()`. Then opening the score file, then the score log, it then opens the guidefile.
From there, it calls `initState()`, to initalize `gf_state`.
It also calls `initPState()` to initalize `state`.
Versions are checked, and if they don't match up, the program is terminated via `fatalErr()`.
Any configuration files are loaded and approprate flags are set.
At this point the start up process is finished, and the infinite loop of `mainLoop()` is started.
