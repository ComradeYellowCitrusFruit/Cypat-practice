# Guide Files

Guide files are files that define the scoring for each image. They follow a specific format.

## Format

### Header

Each file starts with a header section, including data such as the number of conditions. \
\
The header can be described with the following struct:
```C
typedef struct
{
    /* Condition start offset */
    int32_t offset;
    /* Major version number */
    uint16_t majorVer;
    /* Minor version number */
    uint16_t minorVer;
    /* Patch number*/
    uint16_t patch;
    /*  Code for the operating system for the file.
    *   0x01 for Windows
    *   0x10 for Windows Server
    *   0x02 for Ubuntu
    *   0x20 for Ubuntu Server
    *   0x03 for Debian
    *   0x04 for Kali Linux
    *   ox05 for another Linux distribution
    *   0xB1 for OpenBSD
    *   0xB2 for FreeBSD
    */
    char OSCODE;
    /* Operating system version numbers. */
    uint16_t OS_majorVer;
    uint16_t OS_minorVer;
    uint16_t os_patch;
    /* Number of conditions */
    uint16_t conditionCount;
    /* Time for timer in minutes, 0 or -1 will yield no timer. */
    int32_t time;
    /* IP/DNS to send the finished logs and score too, UTF-8 and ASCII only */
    char result_IPoDNS[255];
    /* Number of variables, primarily for metaconditions */
    uint16_t varCount : 12;
} GF_Header_t;
```

### Variables

Variables are not baked into the guidefile, instead they are allocated by the program regulating the image. They are each 16 bit signed integers.

### Conditions

Conditions are the main portion of a guide file, and easily the most complex. They determine the way the scoring will behave on an image. \
 \
Conditions start with a small header described with the following struct:
```c
typedef struct
{
    /* Offset to next condition */
    int nextOffset;
    /* Size of condition in bytes */
    int condSize;
    /* Offset to prev. condition */
    int prevOffset;
    /*  Code for the type of condition
    *   0x00 for file exists
    *   0x01 for directory exists
    *   0x02 for forensics
    *   0x03 for app. installed
    *   0x04 for command results
    *   0x05 for OS version
    *   0x0FF for metacondition
    */
    char typeCode;
} COND_HEADER_T;
```
Conditions contain a main body as well, each varying based on the condition type.

#### Metaconditions

Perhaps the simplest form of condition. It simply is based on the state of a certain variable, or variables. Each metacondition can be described with the following structs:
```c
typedef struct
{
    /* Value stored in the variable*/
    int32_t val
    /* Variable code */
    uint16_t varCode;
} COND_VAR_T;

typedef struct
{
    int32_t scoreVal;
    /* Number of variables */
    uint16_t varCount : 12;
    /* Not actual valid struct code, but whatever */
    COND_VAR_T vars[varCount];
} COND_METACOND_T;
```
